        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>
          Waltz (0.1.62 alpha) is a web.py based web framework for rapidly designing web apps
          in 3/4 time. Waltz comes with batteries; pre-configured and ready to dance.
        </p>

        <h3>Install</h3>
        <pre><code>$ sudo pip install --upgrade waltz</code></pre>

        <h3>Features</h3>
          <p>  
            In one sentence, Waltz abstracts away many of the messy configurations which otherwise
            clutter and complicate your application, and in turn provides clean interfaces and modules to
            speed up your development.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Tracks analytics via @track route decorators</li>
            <li>Stateless, db agnostic modules user authentication modules</li>
            <li>Out-of-the box session support</li>
            <li>Ecommerce features: Shopping cart system complete with coupon/promo support</li>
            <li>lightweight scaffolding for rapid project setup</li>
          </ul>

      <h3>Versus web.py</h3>
        <p>
          Waltz doesn't try to differentiate itself from web.py as a framework.
          Rather, it dances harmoniously with web.py, hand in hand. Waltz 
          intends to be an extension of web.py and requires minimal change
          if you're website is already in web.py. The advantage of using Waltz
          is it allows you to get a website up and running more quickly, abstracting
          away most of the configuration and providing modules to accomplish common 
          websites applications like ecommerce shopping carts.
        </p>

        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
          <p>
            There are two types waltz installs. The latest waltz module (v.0.1.62) is available
            via pip install. An bare-bones starter application, which uses the waltz framework,
            can be downloaded here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/4584751">https://gist.github.com/4584751</a>.  
          </p>
          
          <pre><code>$ sudo pip install --upgrade waltz
          $ mkdir project
          $ cd project
          $ wget https://gist.github.com/raw/4584751/main.py
          $ python main.py # 8080 (follow w/ optional port)
          </code></pre>
        
          <p>
            If you're in a hurry and prefer waltzing with more kick in your step, 
            you can clone the waltz-example repository from github. The example repository
            is a bootstrapped project which includes a simple shopping cart, user account pages,
            login and registration pages, and header + navigation plugins.
          </p>
        
          <pre><code>$ sudo pip install --upgrade waltz
          $ git clone https://github.com/mekarpeles/waltz-example
          $ mv waltz-example project # (rename optional)
          $ cd project
          $ python main.py # 8080 (follow w/ optional port)
          </code></pre>

        <h3>Inspiration</h3>
          <p>
            I [mek] have been using web.py for about five years on several different production
            websites. Web.py offers a simple and understandable interface, is robust, and is easily extensible. 
            However, I find a problem in that I am forced to extend my appications in nearly identical
            ways every time I start a new project. My goal with Waltz is to create a framework
            which is an extension of web.py, yet reduces the friction one encounters when
            trying to get started / configured. In addition, a collection of general purpose
            modules (ecommerce, authentication, social) will be offered (and not enforced), 
            so that hacker entrepreneurs and hackathoners can get their ideas to market more quickly.
